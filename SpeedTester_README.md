Arduino based unit speed tester

The arduino based speed tester tests the speed of a unit driving between two sensors. This tester employs two sensors and an arduino microcontroller to calulate the speed based on the time it takles the unit to travel between two sensors. It is modular meaning a change in loaction or spacing can be made by changing constant values in the program. The code contains functions to run the LCD screen using the LiquidCrystal_I2C library avalible from: http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/LCDi2c.
